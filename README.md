`image-tools` is a tool for mirroring/copying multi-arch container images from the public registry to your own personal registry with manifest list support.

You can use the `image-tools mirror` command to mirror images from the source registry to your own registry.

Or you can use the `image-tools save` and `image-tools load` commands to save the images from the public registry to the tar archive and then load them into your private registry in air-gap mode.

Hangar is a **simple** and **easy-to-use** command line utility for mirroring multi-architecture & multi-platform container images between container image registries. Aiming to simplify the process of copying container images between image registries.

- Hangar allows to copy container images without container runtime (daemon).
- Not restricted by the architecture and OS of the runtime system, it supports running on Linux/Unix systems.
- Supports both docker images and [OCI images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec).
- Hangar supports to copy container images parallelly to improve performance.
- Save and load images with archive files to allow the setup of registry server in Air-Gapped installation.

Hangar provides following functions：

- Mirror container images between image registries (see [mirror](https://hangar.cnrancher.com/docs/v1.7/mirror/mirror) subcommand).
- Save container images into an archive file, and then upload them to the image registry server (see [save](https://hangar.cnrancher.com/docs/v1.7/save/save) and [load](https://hangar.cnrancher.com/docs/v1.7/load/load) subcommands). Designed to use for Air-Gapped (offline) installation.
- Validate commands to verify that the container images were copied correctly (see [validate](https://hangar.cnrancher.com/docs/v1.7/advanced/validate) subcommands).
- Other advanced commands for image list files and archive files (see [advanced usage](https://hangar.cnrancher.com/docs/v1.7/advanced/)).

## Dependencies
